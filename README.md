##  2. <a name='AboutTheProject'></a>About The Project

This wordpress plugin was created to pull in the latest images from ParkourLabs.com into LondonParkour.com so that a nice "isometric" CSS-effect of images could be displayed to show the latest tutorial posts.
To accomplish this, two parts needs to happen:
1. ParkourLabs needed to extend it's REST API so that the custom post type and associated images could be queried.
1. LondonParkour needed a shortcode to communicate with that REST API endpoint, pull the images and render them out in the "isometric" grid.

This plugin concentrates on the second part. It communicates with the API and pulls data.

###  2.1. <a name='BuiltWith'></a>Built With

This project was built with the following frameworks, technologies and software.

* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [PHP](https://php.net/)
* [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

###  2.2. <a name='Installation'></a>Installation

These are the steps to get up and running with this plugin.

1. Clone the repo into your wordpress plugin folder
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__rest--isometric ./wp-content/plugins/ParkourLabs_REST_API_isometric
    ```
1. Insert one of the two shortcodes into your page.
    ```php
    [andyp_rest_isometric] or [andyp_isometric_rest]
    ```

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



##  3. <a name='Usage'></a>Usage

There are two shortcodes available:

###  3.1. <a name='andyp_rest_isometric'></a>`[andyp_rest_isometric]`

The `[andyp_rest_isometric]` shortcode can be used to automatically query the ParkourLabs.com REST API and render the image isometric grid.
Just place wherever needed in your page.

This has a couple of features worth noting:

1. It uses transients of one day. This is to cache the results.
1. It styles the output based on the TailwindCSS Framework.


###  3.2. <a name='andyp_isometric_rest'></a>`[andyp_isometric_rest]`

This shortcode allows for much more flexibility. There are six parameters that can be used to control the output.

1. The number of results you wish to retrieve. Default is 5.
```php
[andyp_isometric_rest count="10"]
```

2. The column of data to order the results. Default is "date"
```php
[andyp_isometric_rest order="date"]
```

3. The posttype to actually search upon. The default is "tutorial".
```php
[andyp_isometric_rest posttype="post"]
```

4. The category name to filter the results upon. The default is null.
```php
[andyp_isometric_rest category="demos"]
```

5. The classes you wish to add to the resulting images. The default is empty.
```php
[andyp_isometric_rest classes="w-10 block rounded"]
```

6   The `content` is anything that's between and opening and close tag. This allows for `{{moustache}}` brackets to substitute any post column to substituted for its value:
```php
[andyp_isometric_rest]
    This is the title: {{post_title}}
[/andyp_isometric_rest]
```

Using this shortcode allows you return multiple posts and display their details:
e.g.
```html
[andyp_isometric_rest posttype="post" count="10" classes="w-10 rounded p-4 bg-gray-500"]
    <h1>{{post_title}} : {{published_date}}</h1>
[/andyp_isometric_rest]
```


##  4. <a name='Customising'></a> Customising

You can simply change the endpoint in the code here:

[https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__REST--labs/blob/master/src/REST/labs_rest.php](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__REST--labs/blob/master/src/REST/labs_rest.php)

Line 20:
```php
public $endpoint = "https://parkourlabs.com/wp-json/wp/v2";
```

[https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__REST--labs/blob/master/src/REST/labs.php](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__REST--labs/blob/master/src/REST/labs.php)
Line 14

```php
public $endpoint = "https://parkourlabs.com/wp-json/wp/v2";
```

##  5. <a name='Troubleshooting'></a>Troubleshooting

If the site is not picking up the JSON and images delete the transients using the WP CLI tool.

```
sudo -u www-data wp transient list
sudo -u www-data wp transient delete labsrest-blog
sudo -u www-data wp transient delete labsrest-demonstration
sudo -u www-data wp transient delete labsrest-tutorial
sudo -u www-data wp transient delete labsstack
```
